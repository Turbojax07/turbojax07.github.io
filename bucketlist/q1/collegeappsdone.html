                Since Sophomore year, I have been thinking about what college I want to go to.  I knew I wanted to study either Computer Science in college, but I didn't have any ideas as to what a good college would be for those programs.  I eventually made a list of about 14 colleges that I would visit and learn more about to see if they interested me.  By the time the summer of 2024 was coming to an end, I decided to shorten the list to my top 5 colleges, and apply to those.  These colleges were Christopher Newport, Randolph Macon, Old Dominion, Liberty, and George Mason.  In August, I applied to the Early Action form for Randolph Macon, and didn't finish the rest of the applications until October 17th.  In a few months, I should start hearing back from these colleges to see whether or not I got accepted.
