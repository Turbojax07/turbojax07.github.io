                Some background:<br>
                CyberPatriot is a national competition hosted by the Air Force Association where teams of students compete to secure an operating system.  The operating systems we will be securing this year are Ubuntu 22, Windows 10, Windows Server 2019, and Linux Mint 21.<br>
                There are 5 rounds of scored competition.  The first two are placement rounds.  Based on the scores you get in those two rounds, you get put into one of three categories, Platinum, Gold, or Silver.<br>
                Round 3 is the first round in your designated category.  To get to round 4, you need to be in the top 25% of your category.  Round 5 is only open to the top 12 teams in the nation, and it is very hard to get to.<br>
                <br>
                This is my third year competing in the CyberPatriot challenge.  As a senior, I wanted to put together one of the better teams at our school and go all out.  I wanted to make a team of 5, as the max number of competitors at one time is 5, but you can have 6 people on your team.  Having a 6th person would just make it more difficult as we would have to figure out a scedule to switch someone out.  I wanted to keep the core 3 people from my original cyberpatriot team, so there were two spots left.  I ended up asking two Juniors to join us, due to their evident skills from the previous year, their rookie year.  A few days after making a group chat, we decided to call the team "Not the NSA."
