                At the beginning of my senior year, our school holds an event known as convocation.  This is basically an event meant to hype up the senior class and get us excited for graduation.  It was a short event where we met in the auditorium for about an hour, and then spent some time outside to take the class photo and take some other photos with our friends.  After the ceremony, all of the seniors had the rest of the day off.
