                In the beginning of last summer, my Grandma found out about a chorus group based out of her church known as the Treble Sounds.&ensp;They are an all-female choir that only meets during the summer.&ensp;At the end of the August, they perform with the all-male group, Summer Sounds, to showcase the songs they've learned over the past three months.&ensp;My family attended the show, and most of the songs were gospel songs, as to be expected by a church-sanctioned event.&ensp;I am sorry to admit that I did find myself beginning to nod off during the performance, but I did manage to stay awake.
