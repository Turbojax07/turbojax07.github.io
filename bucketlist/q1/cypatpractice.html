                If you don't know what CyberPatriot is, I recommend reading <a href="/bucketlist/q1/cypatteam.html">this</a> as I introduce what CyberPatriot is as well as who I am competing with.<br>
                Before the main rounds of competition, CyberPatriot holds a few practice rounds.  As the Linux specialist on my team, I worked with the Linux Mint 21 image.  I wasn't very focused on completing the image, mostly due to the short amount of time I had to work on the image.  I mostly spent my time testing the automated script that I and another teammate had worked on, and this script alone got me 76/100 points!  Unfortunately, I ran some bad code that caused the image to break, where I tried to recover it, as shown in the third image.  I was basically stuck in a terminal window, unable to start the systemd process to begin the graphical interface.  Unable to recover the image, I had to give up early before I could finish the competition.
