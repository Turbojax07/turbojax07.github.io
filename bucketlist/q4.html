                    To get items checked off for this assignment, one of the things I did was go to the Science Museum of Virginia.  I went with my mom, and we had a great time!  The museum had a limited time exhibit showcasing LEGO versions of real-life towers.  People were also encouraged to build something of their own using the legos on each table.  We also checked out their lab area, where they were hosting an activity where you could build a mini golf obstacle using cardboard and some large screws.  I made a ramp with a hole in it that was meant to stop the ball unless you hit it through the hole.  It worked pretty well!  My mom made a castle that you were meant to hit the ball straight through.  the holes were a bit small though, and it was hard to keep them lined up with each other to allow the ball to go straight through.  Overall, it was a great trip, and we both had a lot of fun.

                    I had been excited to do senior assasin since Junior year.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it would be fun to run around and try to shoot people with water guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I could only participate in the first round.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to go out of town during round 2, which would automatically put me out.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my round one experience was fun!  I found my target fairly quickly, but wasn't able to get them.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had found their house, but they parked in their garage, which is an off-limits zone for the assassins.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I wasn't the only person to find my target quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who was trying to assassinate me found where I lived, and got me while I was coming home from my targets house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, my senior assassin was very fun!  I am a bit glad I stopped so early though, as I heard later on about two girls trying to hijack someone's car to get the person inside.

                <p class="info">Technically, our school does two senior walks.  This is the first one.  For this walk, we visit the schools we went to before high school.  The day of, I didn't quite get the schedule right.  I went directly to my elementary school when I realized that I was meant to check in at Deep Run first.  I rushed over, barely made it on time, and ran right back out to get back to the school.  I was one of the few kids from Deep Run there, but I did see a lot of kids from other schools that I knew a long time ago.  While going through the school, I made sure to check in on some of my teachers, and they remembered me!  Two of them had even retired and came back to see the students they taught.  I also made sure to see my neighbors who go there now, and they were excited to see me.  After elementary school, I went to the middle school.  They had a bit more of a ceremony, with a bunch of decorations set up around the gym.  This time, more people from Deep Run were there, so I hung out with them.  I didn't recognize any of the teachers, </p>

                <p class="info">FIRST Championships!  This is the first time we had been to the worldwide competition since 2017!  It is in Houston, in a building with three floors of competitions, extravaganzas, and discussions.  On the first floor was the main food area, as well as the FRC competition fields.  FRC is a larger robotics challenge that our school competes in.  At worlds, there were 8 fields with 2 sections for pit stations.  Around the fields, you could find a formula 1 car, some NASA vehicles, and booths for multiple supporters of FIRST in both the hardware and software regions.  Quick reminder, 1 FRC field is about as large as a basketball field.  8 of them, with stands, is an absurd amount of space!  Moving on to the second floor, it was a lot smaller.  Most of the first floor was two stories high, so the second floor had a lot of observation platforms you could view the competition from.  It also had an event called the Innovation Fair, which had even more companies showing their products and talking about what they do.  There was also a college row, with colleges from all around the US.  VCU was there!  Moving on to the third floor, there was a competition area for both the FTC and FLL competitions.  They take up less space than FRC, so they were able to fit in one area.  The third floor also hosted multiple presentations on topics like new hardware developments, ways to increase inclusivity, and some good software practices to use.  The competiton itself was very fun!  Our team, Blue Cheese, was in the Milstein division.  We ended up placing 48th out of the 75 in the division, and won the judges award!</p>

                <p class="info">So, I wasn't a fan of our junior year prom.  It was too loud for me, and I had gone by myself instead of being part of a group.  Because of this, I wasn't planning on going to this year's prom, but my plans changed.  A day before registration closed, some of the people on my robotics team invited me to go with them!  I agreed, and rushed to submit the form before the end of the day.  The day of prom, we went to a nearby park to take photos.  My dad, being the artistic person he is, arraged us all in various poses and places, allowing us to get a multitude of great shots of our group.  After photos, we went downtown to a restaurant called the Secret Sandwich Society.  Most of us, believe it or not, got sandwiches. (One guy only got two sides of fries)  As for the actual dance, the music was somehow even louder than before, and I had to sit down because I was getting nauseous.  After the dance, we went to one of our friend's houses, and spent some time together to build legos and watch a movie.</p>
