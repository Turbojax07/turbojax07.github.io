                    In late October, Blue Cheese Robotics hosted a robotics competition called "Rumble with Cheese."  To spread the word about the event, we decided to paint the spirit rock outside of the school.&nbsp;&nbsp;The photos aren't great because we painted it at night, but 5 of us helped out.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were planning on recording a promotion video at night as well, but the camera quality wasn't great, so they had to retake it in the morning.

                    Makerfest is a community event where people in our area get together and share the things they've made or how to make them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one was in 2019, and it was shut down due to covid.&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Blue Cheese Robotics helped bring it back.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was stationed at the 3d printing table where I would tell people how 3d printers worked, and show them some of the stuff we've made.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did my best, but I haven't actually used a 3d printer, so my explanations were very simplistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the event went well, and I saw groups such as the American Radio Relay League and RABID Robotics there too.

                    After Makerfest, we went to Comedy Sportz.&nbsp;&nbsp;Comedy Sportz is an improv show where two teams of three compete in various games to make the audience laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will even bring up people from the audience every once in a while and have them compete or give ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a fun trip, and I'd like to go again.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I don't like going up on the stage, so I may try to avoid being picked.

                    Every year, my family celebrates Christmas twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;On Christmas Eve we go to one of my grandparent's house, and on Christmas Day we go to the other grandparents house.&nbsp;&nbsp;On both days, we play games, have dinner, and open presents.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a great time for everyone!  This year, we had a few more guests on Christmas Eve than normal because my cousins from North Carolina came up with their grandparents.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone was happy that they were there as we don't see them very often.&nbsp;&nbsp;I got a few cool things from my grandparents, including a new phone (not an expensive one), some multitool pens, and plenty of candy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a great time, and it was amazing having everyone together.

                    Around Christmastime, my parents signed up for an online contest to get professional photos taken with our pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;We ended up being one of the winners, and scheduled our photos to be taken a few days after Christmas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the photography group won't let us get digital versions of our photos (At least not without a steep price), so the best I can do is a photo my mom and I took outside while we were exploring the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the photo experience was interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain our dog's interest, the photographer would make quick noises like cats meowing or clicks and whistles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The photos turned out well when we were shown them, but we won't get them for a while as the framing process takes some time.
