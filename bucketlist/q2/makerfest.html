            <p>Makerfest is a community event where people in our area get together and share the things they've made or how to make them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one was in 2019, and it was shut down due to covid.&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Blue Cheese Robotics helped bring it back.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was stationed at the 3d printing table where I would tell people how 3d printers worked, and show them some of the stuff we've made.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did my best, but I haven't actually used a 3d printer, so my explanations were very simplistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the event went well, and I saw groups such as the American Radio Relay League and RABID Robotics there too.</p>
