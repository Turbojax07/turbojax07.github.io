            <p>In late October, Blue Cheese Robotics hosted a robotics competition called "Rumble with Cheese."  To spread the word about the event, we decided to paint the spirit rock outside of the school.&nbsp;&nbsp;The photos aren't great because we painted it at night, but 5 of us helped out.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were planning on recording a promotion video at night as well, but the camera quality wasn't great, so they had to retake it in the morning.
