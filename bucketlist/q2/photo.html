            <p>Around Christmastime, my parents signed up for an online contest to get professional photos taken with our pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;We ended up being one of the winners, and scheduled our photos to be taken a few days after Christmas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the photography group won't let us get digital versions of our photos (At least not without a steep price), so the best I can do is a photo my mom and I took outside while we were exploring the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the photo experience was interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain our dog's interest, the photographer would make quick noises like cats meowing or clicks and whistles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The photos turned out well when we were shown them, but we won't get them for a while as the framing process takes some time.</p>
