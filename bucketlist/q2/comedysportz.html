            <p>After Makerfest, we went to Comedy Sportz.&nbsp;&nbsp;Comedy Sportz is an improv show where two teams of three compete in various games to make the audience laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will even bring up people from the audience every once in a while and have them compete or give ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a fun trip, and I'd like to go again.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I don't like going up on the stage, so I may try to avoid being picked.</p>
