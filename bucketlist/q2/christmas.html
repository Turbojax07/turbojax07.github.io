            <p>Every year, my family celebrates Christmas twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;On Christmas Eve we go to one of my grandparent's house, and on Christmas Day we go to the other grandparents house.&nbsp;&nbsp;On both days, we play games, have dinner, and open presents.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a great time for everyone!  This year, we had a few more guests on Christmas Eve than normal because my cousins from North Carolina came up with their grandparents.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone was happy that they were there as we don't see them very often.&nbsp;&nbsp;I got a few cool things from my grandparents, including a new phone (not an expensive one), some multitool pens, and plenty of candy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a great time, and it was amazing having everyone together.</p>
